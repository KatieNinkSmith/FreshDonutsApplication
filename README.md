## Fresh Donuts

A local donut shop that makes amazing donuts, they do not have a website and word of mouth/google review are the only way others know about them.

My goal is to create a website for them to use proudly! They have little to no online presents.

I would like to keep it simple a home page and a menu location information in the footer. https://wireframe.cc/sNGzNJ
